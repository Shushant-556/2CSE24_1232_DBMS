# 📂 MySQL Practice Sheet

This repository contains my **MySQL Database Management System (DBMS) practice work**, created as part of academic learning and hands-on SQL implementation.  
It includes a collection of SQL queries covering **database creation, data manipulation, retrieval operations, and analytical functions** using an Employee database.

---

## 📚 About the Project

The objective of this project is to strengthen my understanding of **MySQL DBMS concepts** through practical implementation.  
All queries are written and tested on an **Employee database**, focusing on real-world database operations and query optimization.

This repository serves as a **practice reference** as well as a **learning record** for DBMS fundamentals.
